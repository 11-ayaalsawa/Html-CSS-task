<p><strong>Lorem Ipsum</strong> is simply dummy text of
     the printing and typesetting industry.
      Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's
       standard dummy text ever since the 1500s,
        when an unknown printer took a galley 
        of type and scrambled it to make a type
         specimen<em>book</em> . It has survived not only five centuries
         , but also the leap into electronic typesetting,
          remaining essentially unchanged.
          It was popularised in the 1960s
           with the release of Letraset sheets
            containing Lorem Ipsum passages, 
            and more recently with desktop publishing 
            software like Aldus PageMaker including 
            versions of Lorem Ipsum. </p>
